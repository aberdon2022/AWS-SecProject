# Cloud Security AWS Honeypot - Analyzing Threats in the Cloud

## Summary

This project aims to demonstrate the importance of cloud security by setting up a honeypot in AWS. We will create a secure VPC with public and private subnets and deploy honepot instances to monitor and analyze threats in the cloud. We will also configure security groups, IAM roles, and S3 buckets to store logs and monitor the honeypot instances.
