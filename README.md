# AWS VPC Setup Project for Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Summary

The objective of this project is to create and configurate a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS) while, in the process, assure a strong understanding of cloud networking and the security aspect related to.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand the fundamentals of cloud networking.
- To learn how to configure a secure VPC in AWS.
- To apply cybersecurity best practices in a cloud environment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:
- An AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services.
- Understanding of networking concepts.
- Familiarity with cybersecurity principles.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating the AWS account
We will be using the eu-west-1 (Ireland) region for this project.

### 2. Setting up the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- [x] Creation of subnets

  - Public Subnet:
    - CIDR Block: 10.0.1.0/28
    - Availability Zone: eu-west-1a
    - Route Table: Public Route Table
    - **Screenshot:**

  - Private Subnet:
    - CIDR Block: 10.0.2.0/28
    - Availability Zone: eu-west-1b
    - Route Table: Private Route Table

- [x] Internet Gateway\
Next, we will create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC in order to allow the VPC to connect to the Internet.

- [x] Route Tables\
We will create two route tables: one for the public subnet and another for the private subnet, and associate them accordingly with the proper subnets.

  - Public Route Table:

  - Private Route Table:

  As you can see, the public route table has a route to the Internet Gateway, while the private route table doesn't.
  
- [x] EC2 Instances\
Now we will launch an EC2 instance where we will install Juice Shop, an intentionally vulnerable web application, we will also setup a security group to allow access to the instance and a key pair to connect to it.

- [x] Security Groups\

- [x] IAM Roles\
We will define two IAM roles: one for access the EC2 instance with SSM and another for storing the logs in an S3 bucket and monitoring the instance with CloudWatch.

The IAM role for the EC2 instance will have the following permissions:

  - AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore (to allow access to the EC2 instance with SSM)
  - AmazonS3FullAccess (to allow access to the S3 bucket)
  - Custom S3 policy to allow the EC2 instance to upload, download and list objects in the bucket

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
			  "Effect": "Allow",
			  "Action": [
				  "s3:PutObject",
				  "s3:GetObject",
				  "s3:ListBucket"
			  ],
			  "Resource": [
				  "arn:aws:s3:::juiceshop-logs",
				  "arn:aws:s3::::juiceshop-logs/*"
			  ]
		  }
	  ]
  }

Now we will attach the roles to the EC2 instance.

- [x] S3 Bucket and CloudWatch Logs\
We will create an S3 bucket to store the logs generated by the EC2 instance and use CloudWatch to monitor the instance.\
The S3 bucket will have the following configuration:

  - Bucket Name: `juiceshop-logs`
  - Region: `eu-west-1`
  - Block all public access
  - Cypher used: SSE-S3

Also the S3 bucket will have a bucket policy to allow the EC2 instance to upload, download and list the objects in the bucket.
